# Fend Compiler

Fend is my hobby-project object oriented programming language. The Fend Compiler is an implementation of Fend which runs on a bytecode virtual machine written in C.

## Instructions

The Fend Compiler can be ran as a repl by calling it with no arguments, or with a single argument of a path to the targeted fend file. Some systems may not support
NaN Boxing. If the fend compiler behaves unexpectedly, please remove the definition of NaN Boxing in the common header file.
